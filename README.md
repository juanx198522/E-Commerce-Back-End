# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
I completed a started code of the back end for an e-commerce site. Iâ€™ve taken a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation
- Node.js 
- Express.js 
- Sequelize
- mysql2 

## Usage
When you add the database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then you are able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
When you enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
When you enter the command to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
When you open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
When you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then you are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
